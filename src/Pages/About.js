Since making this portfolio the first time I ahve learned many new skills and have become very confident in HTML and CSS. My javascript knowledge and skills are my weakest point But I am still learning and working. I am a hardworking and determined worker. You will never get anthing less than 100%. I also will be creative and come up with unique and imaginative ways to solve the problem. I have learned some new skills as you can see with this react app but i am still learning so everything is not at its best quality. Hope you enjoy the app!</h1>
